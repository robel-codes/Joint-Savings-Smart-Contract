# Joint-Savings-Smart-Contract

Joint saving smart contract automates many of the financial processes and features, such as hosting joint savings. To automate I have created a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account.

Analysis include

- Creating a Joint savings Account Contract in Solidity
- Compiling and Deployment fo Contract in JavaScript VM
- Intreaction with the Deployed Smart Contract
